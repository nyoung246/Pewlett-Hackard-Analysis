# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to assist Bobby in completing two more assignments assign by his manager. The first assignment includes determining the number of retiring employees per title, also considering whether they have held multiple positions. The second assignment was to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program based on current employees and their birth dates. 

## Results:

Four Major points from the two analysis deliverables are as follows:

•	After the first analysis to determine which employees by title are retiring, it is shown in the above photo that there is a total of 10,163 employees eligible to retire.

•	The above photo also shows us the current titles/positions of each retiring employee. This will assist Pewlett Hackard’s HR team to determine which positions will need to be filled.

•	The second analysis shows us the employees’ eligibility for the mentorship. The list of employees eligible were exported into a CSV ([mentorship_eligibilty.csv](https://github.com/nyoung246/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/data/mentorship_eligibilty.csv)).

•	The list of eligible employees for the mentorship program will assist Pewlett Hackard to determine which current employees are best to mentor the new employees. This also provides each employee’s title, which includes whether that employees holds a Senior position as well; which may be preferred when mentoring new employes.

## Summary: 

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
•	There will be around 10,163 roles at Pewlett Hackard that will need to be filled due to employees retiring

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
•	Unfortunately, there are only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program for the 10,163 roles that will need to be filled. This may possibly lead to every eligible employee on the mentorship program being assigned around 7 new employees to mentor. As there are so many employees eligible to retire and a smaller number of employees eligible for the mentorship, Pewlett Hackard may want to open the mentorship eligibility to more employees by extending the birth date range to help mentor new employees. They can also create a mentorship training program, especially for the "silver tsunami" as it is quite a large number to handle.
